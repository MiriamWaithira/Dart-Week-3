# Dart-Week-3
These are the answers to Dart Week 3 Assignment.
The topics discussed here are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. These topics are illustrated in the different files in this repository as follows.
1. Encapsulation (Encapsultion.dart)
Encapsulation is demonstrated through the 'BankAccount' class, which uses private variables and public methods to control access to sensitive data. The balance is stored in a private variable, and access to it is managed through getter methods and controlled by methods like 'deposit()' and 'withdraw()'. This ensures data protection by limiting direct access to the internal state.

2. Inheritance (Inheritance.dart)
Inheritance is showcased by the 'Laptop' superclass and its subclasses 'Dell' and 'HP'. The subclasses inherit common properties (such as 'name', 'processor', and 'generation') from the parent 'Laptop' class, while passing specific values to the constructor. This example highlights how inheritance allows code reuse and creates relationships between objects.

3. Polymorphism (Polymorphism.dart)
Polymorphism is illustrated by the 'Vehicle' abstract class and its 'Car' and 'Bicycle' subclasses. Both subclasses implement the 'calculateSpeed()' method differently based on the type of vehicle, but they follow the same method formula. This demonstrates how polymorphism allows for different behaviors in inherited methods, depending on the subclass.

4. Abstraction (Abstraction.dart)
Abstraction is demonstrated using the 'Language' abstract class, which defines the structure of a 'greet()' method. Subclasses such as 'English', 'Indian', and 'French' provide their own unique implementation of the 'greet()' method. This example highlights how abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding implementation details and exposing only essential methods.

These examples provide a clear, concise overview of how OOP principles are applied in Dart. Each file focuses on a specific OOP concept and shows how it can be used to create efficient, reusable, and maintainable code.

HAPPY CODING!!!
